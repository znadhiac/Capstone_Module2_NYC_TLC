# A DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS FOR IMPROVING NYC GREEN TAXI SERVICES 
This analysis of New York City's Green Taxi service, based on January 2023 trip data, identifies key patterns in demand, fare structure, and passenger behavior, offering recommendations to optimize fleet deployment, pricing strategies, and service planning. The findings highlight peak demand times, high-traffic locations, factors influencing fare amounts, and preferences for digital payments, providing actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and service equity.

## I. INTRODUCTION

### **Background**  
With over 8 million residents in a densely populated and diverse city, New York City requires a robust and adaptable transportation system. To manage this, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) was established in 1971 to license and regulate the city’s for-hire services, including Yellow and Green Taxis, app-based ride services (like Uber and Lyft), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. 

While Yellow Taxis primarily serve central Manhattan, Green Taxis, that launched by the TLC in 2013 under the Livery Passenger Enhancement Program, were introduced to expand street-hail service to the outer boroughs and upper Manhattan, where transportation access had historically been limited. Unlike Yellow Taxis, Green Taxis are restricted from picking up passengers in central Manhattan and instead focus on areas with lower taxi availability.

Analyzing how Green Taxis are used is essential for improving transportation equity and operational efficiency in underserved neighborhoods. Examination of TLC-collected trip data can reveal patterns in demand, highlight how trip characteristics influence fare structures, and provide insights into passenger behavior. These findings can support informed decision-making by the TLC and other stakeholders regarding vehicle distribution, pricing strategies, and service planning, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and inclusive transportation system across New York City.

### **Business Problems**  
Green Taxis were introduced to improve transportation access in NYC’s outer boroughs and upper Manhattan, yet challenges in optimizing their operations remain. This project addresses the following key questions:

1. **When is the peak demand?**  
Identifying peak times can improve vehicle availability and reduce wait times.

2. **Where is high demand concentrated?**  
Mapping high-demand pickup areas helps position drivers more effectively and minimize idle time.

3. **What affects fare amounts?**  
Analyzing trip features like distance and duration offers insight into fare structure and driver earnings.

4. **How do passengers travel and pay?**  
Understanding ride-sharing patterns and payment preferences supports better service planning.

### **Objectives**  

To address the key business problems, this analysis focuses on the following objectives:

1. **Determine peak demand periods** by analyzing trip volumes across different hours and days.
2. **Identify high-demand locations** by examining pickup distribution across boroughs and zones.
3. **Analyze fare-influencing factors** by exploring the relationship between trip characteristics (distance and duration) and fare amounts.
4. **Understand passenger behavior** by analyzing patterns in passenger count and preferred payment methods.
<br>  
### **Scope and Limitations**   

This analysis uses January 2023 trip data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and excludes seasonal variations, long-term trends outside the timeframe, external factors (such as weather, traffic, or events), and comparisons with app-based ride services like Uber or Lyft.
