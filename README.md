# A DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS FOR IMPROVING NYC GREEN TAXI SERVICES 
This analysis of New York City's Green Taxi service, based on January 2023 trip data, identifies key patterns in demand, fare structure, and passenger behavior, offering recommendations to optimize fleet deployment, pricing strategies, and service planning. The findings highlight peak demand times, high-traffic locations, factors influencing fare amounts, and preferences for digital payments, providing actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and service equity.

## I. INTRODUCTION

### **Background**  
With over 8 million residents in a densely populated and diverse city, New York City requires a robust and adaptable transportation system. To manage this, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) was established in 1971 to license and regulate the city’s for-hire services, including Yellow and Green Taxis, app-based ride services (like Uber and Lyft), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. 

While Yellow Taxis primarily serve central Manhattan, Green Taxis, that launched by the TLC in 2013 under the Livery Passenger Enhancement Program, were introduced to expand street-hail service to the outer boroughs and upper Manhattan, where transportation access had historically been limited. Unlike Yellow Taxis, Green Taxis are restricted from picking up passengers in central Manhattan and instead focus on areas with lower taxi availability.

Analyzing how Green Taxis are used is essential for improving transportation equity and operational efficiency in underserved neighborhoods. Examination of TLC-collected trip data can reveal patterns in demand, highlight how trip characteristics influence fare structures, and provide insights into passenger behavior. These findings can support informed decision-making by the TLC and other stakeholders regarding vehicle distribution, pricing strategies, and service planning, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and inclusive transportation system across New York City.  

### **Business Problems**  
Green Taxis were introduced to improve transportation access in NYC’s outer boroughs and upper Manhattan, yet challenges in optimizing their operations remain. This project addresses the following key questions:

1. **When is the peak demand?**  
Identifying peak times can improve vehicle availability and reduce wait times.

2. **Where is high demand concentrated?**  
Mapping high-demand pickup areas helps position drivers more effectively and minimize idle time.

3. **What affects fare amounts?**  
Analyzing trip features like distance and duration offers insight into fare structure and driver earnings.

4. **How do passengers travel and pay?**  
Understanding ride-sharing patterns and payment preferences supports better service planning.

### **Objectives**  
To address the key business problems, this analysis focuses on the following objectives:

1. **Determine peak demand periods** by analyzing trip volumes across different hours and days.
2. **Identify high-demand locations** by examining pickup distribution across boroughs and zones.
3. **Analyze fare-influencing factors** by exploring the relationship between trip characteristics (distance and duration) and fare amounts.
4. **Understand passenger behavior** by analyzing patterns in passenger count and preferred payment methods.

### **Scope and Limitations**  
This analysis uses January 2023 trip data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and excludes seasonal variations, long-term trends outside the timeframe, external factors (such as weather, traffic, or events), and comparisons with app-based ride services like Uber or Lyft.

## IV. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  

### Conclusion  
This project analyzed green taxi trip data across time, location, fare factors, and passenger behavior to uncover key usage patterns and operational opportunities.

1. **Time-Based Demand**
    - Weekday demand is structured, with Tuesday as the busiest day and peaks at 8 AM, 4 PM, and 5 PM.
    - Commuting hours (7–9 AM, 3–6 PM) show consistently high demand; 6 PM is the busiest hour overall.
    - Late night (12–5 AM) has minimal activity—ideal for maintenance and repositioning.
    - Weekend demand is lower and leisure-driven, peaking softly at 3 PM, with Sunday being the slowest.

2. **Location-Based Demand**
    - Manhattan dominates pickups (over 60%), especially East Harlem, needing continuous, peak-aware coverage.
    - Queens and Brooklyn offer growth areas: Queens via airport and residential demand, Brooklyn via event zones like Fort Greene.
    - Bronx and Staten Island have <2% of trips, suitable for limited or on-demand service.

3. **Fare Insights**
    - Fare is highly correlated with distance (0.86), making it key for pricing and revenue strategies.
    - Trip duration has little impact on fare (0.09) and is less useful for planning.
    - Distance and duration are not strongly linked (0.07), underscoring traffic unpredictability.

4. **Passenger Behavior**
    - Most trips (86.75%) are solo, favoring small, efficient vehicles. Ride-sharing could be promoted via incentives.
    - Larger groups are rare, suggesting limited use for large vehicles.
    - Card payments lead (64.88%), supporting loyalty programs and better data collection.
    - Cash is still used (34.79%), especially by tourists or older adults—highlighting a need for inclusive digital transition.

### Recommendation  
Drawing on insights from the analysis of Trip Demand Over Time, Trip Demand by Location, Fare-Related Factors, and Passenger Behavior, the following recommendations aim to optimize Green Taxi operations:  

1. **Time-Based Demand Optimization:**  
    - Green Taxi services should increase fleet presence during weekday peak hours (6–10 AM and 3–6 PM), especially on Tuesdays and Fridays. On weekends, focus on 10 AM–6 PM leisure traffic.  
    - Reduce operations during low-yield times, like 12–5 AM and Sundays, using those periods for maintenance, driver training, or system updates.  
    Apply surge pricing and driver incentives during peak demand windows, while offering discounts and loyalty rewards during off-peak hours to better balance supply and demand.  

2. **Location-Based Fleet Strategy:**  
    - Prioritize Manhattan, particularly East Harlem, due to its consistent, high demand throughout the day.  
    - Adopt a tiered coverage strategy:  
        - Tier 1: High-density zones (e.g., East Harlem, Central Park) receive continuous coverage.  
        - Tier 2: Moderate-demand areas (e.g., Forest Hills, Astoria) are covered during their peak hours.  
        - Tier 3: Low-demand areas (e.g., Bronx, Staten Island) receive minimal or on-demand coverage.  
    - In Queens, allocate airport-appropriate vehicles and manage overflow using midday rotations. Reserve additional capacity for zones with late afternoon peaks like Central Harlem and Astoria.  

3. **Fare Modeling and Revenue Strategy:**  
    - Build fare models around trip distance, which has a stronger correlation with fare than duration.  
    - Encourage longer trips during off-peak times through driver reward programs.  
    - Utilize real-time traffic data to improve routing efficiency and trip turnover.  
    - Focus marketing on high-value segments, such as airport transfers and cross-borough trips, which offer better revenue potential. 

4. **Passenger Behavior and Service Design:**  
    - Given that 87% of trips involve a single passenger, prioritize compact, fuel-efficient vehicles.  
    - Promote ride-sharing in high-demand zones through app features, discounts, and sustainability messaging to help reduce congestion.    
    - Deploy larger vehicles strategically around airports, hotels, and event venues, with pre-booking options to match passenger group sizes.  
    - Leverage the high rate of digital payments (65%) for customer insights, loyalty programs, and transparent operations. Encourage further digital adoption through perks while maintaining cash options for accessibility.
